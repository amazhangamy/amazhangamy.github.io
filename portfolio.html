    <p><b>Bio: </b>Hi! I'm from Rancho Cucamonga, and I absolutely love watching Netflix. Currently, my favorite show has got to be New Girl. I like to consider myself a good student, but I do have a problem with procrastinating. I live with my parents, my little sister, and my beloved dog, Coco.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <p><b>Likes: </b>I love dogs, and I make sure that everyone knows it. I also enjoy reading and writing.<br>
      <b>Dislikes: </b>I highly dislike piano, but of course, my parents would disown me if I didn't keep playing. Sorry mom and dad!<br>
    </p>
    
      <p><b>Fun Fact: </b>My favorite type of music is EDM, also known as electronic dance music. My friend and I are just counting down the days until we'll be able to see our favorite DJs in action!<br></p>

      <b>Side Scroller Project</b><br>
      Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!<br><br>
